# helsinki_cycle_paths
Collaborative map with ratings of Helsinki bike paths. I create the routes in brouter.de, and then modify them in geojson.io to add a column with rating and whether a segment is next to a road.


The rating system I'm going for is as follows:
1. Minimal bike infrastructure. Includes painted bicycle lanes or, if speed limit is below 30 kph, no bike lane at all
2. ...
3. ...
4. Narrow bike lane, on sidewalk
5. ...
6. Bike lane, structurally separate from the road, wide enough for easy two-way traffic
7. ...
8. ...
9. ...
10. Bicycle "highway". Two-way bicycle road not adjacent to a car road. May there be plenty.

Suggestions to this rating scheme are welcome! How would you rate shared use pathways (with pedestrians and bikes mixed)?
